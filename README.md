### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [ReactHookForm](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For form validation
- [react-responsive](https://github.com/yocontra/react-responsive) - For CSS media queries in react

### What I learned
During my work on the Product Feedback App challenge, I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience in various aspects of web development:

- **React State Management:** I deepened my understanding of state management in React. I effectively utilized state to monitor feedback queries, separate functions within the context, and manage their respective statuses, resulting in a dynamic and interactive user interface.

- **Responsive Design:** Implementing responsive design principles proved essential to ensure the app's seamless functionality across a range of screen sizes. I mastered the use of media queries to adapt the layout and styling, and I employed the `react-responsive` library to detect mobile devices.

- **Form Validation:** I successfully implemented form validation for both creating and editing feedback. This enhancement guarantees that users receive meaningful feedback during their interactions with the app.

- **Dynamic Vertical Line CSS:** I acquired a new skill in creating dynamic vertical lines based on reply comments. This added feature provides an engaging and visually appealing aspect to the app's interface.
